# Personas

## As a brewery…

I want to create an **account** as a **brewery**, so that I can add **details** about the brewery and add **beers** that we've made. For initial setup I want an easy way to add beers such as a csv file.
I would also like to be able to see stats on different **beers**, such as **ratings**, amount drank and possibly **price** related stuff.

## As a bar manager…

I want to create an account as a **bar**, so that I can add details about the bar and claim a unique **slug**. I should be able to easily set ip the **tap list** based on existing **beers** or easily add a new one if I can’t find it already.

I want to be able to track performance and ROI of different **beers** and see how long it was **tapped** for.

## As a beer explorer…

I want to find **bars** that are have **beers** on tap by **location**, **beer style** and/or **brewery**.

I want to be able to create an **account** so that I have a unique profile and connect with friends to share **beers** that I’m drinking and give it a **rating**. I should be able to quickly check in a **beer** based on the **bar** that I’m in and add the **beer** to the **tap list** if it is not already there. If I’m drinking a can or bottle, I should be able to check it in without affecting the **tap list**.
