# Next.js rules

- Use the App Router structure with `page.tsx` files in route directories.
- Follow Next.js 15 conventions such as async dynamic APIs like `cookies`, `header`, and `params`. Use `useActionsState` instead of `useFormState`.
- Client components must be explicitly marked with `'use client'` at the top of the file.
- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-form`) and PascalCase for component files.
- Prefer named exports over default exports, i.e. `export function Button() { /* ... */ }` instead of `export default function Button() { /* ... */ }`.

## Data Fetching & Mutations

- **Server Components (RSCs) are the default for data fetching.** Fetch initial page data directly within `async` Server Components (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`) using standard `async/await`. Avoid client-side fetching for initial data rendering.
- **All mutations (Create, Update, Delete) must use Server Actions.** Implement all mutation logic as Server Actions (`'use server';` directive, typically in `src/actions/`).
- **Never use API routes for internal app logic.** `/api` routes are reserved only for true external APIs (webhooks, 3rd party integrations). Do not use `/api` for CRUD, auth, or any internal data flow.
- **After successful mutations in Server Actions, always use `revalidatePath()` or `revalidateTag()` to invalidate the Next.js cache and trigger automatic data refetching in RSCs.**
- **For dynamic data fetching in Client Components (e.g., search-as-you-type), use Server Actions that return the fetched data directly to the calling Client Component.**

## State Management & Loading

- **URL Search Params for Server State:** Manage state that affects server-fetched data (pagination, filters, sorting) using URL Search Parameters. Client components should use `useRouter` (from `next/navigation`) to update the URL, triggering RSCs to re-fetch with new parameters. Use libraries like `nuqs` for easier management if needed.
- **Route Loading with `loading.tsx`:** Use `loading.tsx` files alongside `page.tsx` to leverage React Suspense for automatic loading UI during route transitions and initial server component data fetching.
- **Action Pending States:**
  - In forms submitting via `<form action={...}>`, use the `useFormStatus` hook (from `react-dom`) in a dedicated child component (e.g., `<SubmitButton />`) to get pending state.
  - For Server Actions called programmatically (e.g., `onClick={async () => { await myAction(); }}`), wrap the call in `startTransition` (from `useTransition`) to get pending state within the Client Component.
- **Minimize Client-Side Server State Libraries:** Reduce reliance on libraries like React Query for standard data fetching and mutations, as RSCs + Server Actions + Revalidation cover most common use cases. Consider them only for advanced client-side caching needs or real-time client features.
- **Minimize `'use client'` directives:**
  - Keep most components as React Server Components (RSC)
  - Only use client components when you need interactivity (state, effects, browser APIs).
  - Wrap interactive client components in `<Suspense>` with fallback UI if they fetch data or are heavy.
  - Create small client component wrappers around interactive elements rather than making large components client-side.
- **Avoid unnecessary `useState` and `useEffect`:** Leverage Server Components and Server Actions where possible instead of managing server state on the client.

## Summary

- **No `/api` routes for internal app logicâ€”use Server Actions for all mutations and dynamic data.**
- **Fetch data in RSCs, mutate via Server Actions, revalidate as needed.**
- **Keep client code minimal and only for interactivity.**
